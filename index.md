# GROWTH MINDSET

## What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

### There are two types of Mindset:

●Fixed mindset: believing basic qualities, like intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. Believing that talent alone creates success—without effort.

●Growth mindset: believing that people’s most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point.
